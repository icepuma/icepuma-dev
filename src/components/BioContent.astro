	<h2>Senior software & DevOps engineer shipping end-to-end</h2>
	<p>
		I'm Stefan Ruzitschka, a Berlin-based builder with 15+ years of experience taking web products from idea to reliable production. I like owning the full loop—design, implementation, instrumentation, rollout, and the follow-up fixes that make things robust. I work across TypeScript/React/Astro, Rust/Node, and JVM backends, and I lean on feature flags, metrics, and coding agents to ship fast without surprises.
	</p>

	<h3>What I'm doing right now</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Senior DevOps engineer/consultant embedded in product and platform teams to keep infrastructure reliable and quick to ship.</li>
		<li>Helping B2B and B2C teams migrate legacy systems, decompose monoliths, and run safer delivery pipelines.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How I like to work</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Start with the problem, baseline with instrumentation, ship a thin slice, and watch the numbers before widening rollout.</li>
		<li>Comfortable moving between product decisions, data plumbing, backend APIs, and front-end polish.</li>
		<li>Write concise RFCs, prefer async collaboration, and pair when velocity or clarity needs it.</li>
		<li>Enjoy deleting code and simplifying flows once the signal is clear.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Stack and tools I reach for</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Languages: TypeScript/JavaScript, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Go, Scala, Python, Bash.</li>
		<li>Frameworks: React, Astro, Spring, Ktor, Play Framework, Axum.</li>
		<li>Ops: Kubernetes/OpenShift, AWS/Azure, Terraform/CloudFormation/Ansible, Grafana/Loki/Prometheus/Splunk.</li>
		<li>Delivery: Helm/Kustomize/Timoni, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins, feature flags, observability first.</li>
	</ul>
